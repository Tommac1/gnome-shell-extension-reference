> You should have read [Getting Started](../GETTING-STARTED.md) file first.

Now you will learn how to use [popupMenu.js](../REFERENCE.md#popupmenujs). 

At this point you should know how to create a basic extension and how to enable it.

```bash
gnome-shell-extension-tool --create-extension
# Name: popupmenu
# Description: popupmenu example
# UUID: popupmenu@yourname.com
```
